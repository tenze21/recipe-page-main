## Overview
I took up this problem to refresh my knowledge of **HTML** symantics. I have carefully chosen the **HTML** elements by double checking their usecases on  (MDN web docs)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML]. Thought it would be a piece of cake but I guess I really underestimated this challenge styling those list and getting them to align similarly to the design really got me *scratching my head* ðŸ˜‚.

## My process
As usual I thoroughly inspected the design and started planning on using proper **HTML** elements by reading about them on the MDN web docsas this challenge was all about proper *HTML symantics*.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- After doing this project I have become much aware of using proper HTML symantics.
- I have also learned some amazing tricks on styling list items and using the `::marker` psuedo-element I have shared the resources for it in the [resources section](#useful-resources).
- I guess I really learned a lot of things I can do with lists while doing this challenge.
- while doing this project I also came across some resources on writing good `alt` text on the frontend mentor discord channel. Will link it in the resources section.


### Continued development
I am gonna focus on trying to make my projects more accessible.


### Useful resources

- [How to write good alt text for screen readers.](https://craigabbott.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-good-alt-text-for-screen-readers/) - This article dives extensively on the importance of a good `alt` text and how to come up with one.
- [custom bullets with CSS ::marker](https://web.dev/articles/css-marker-pseudo-element) - As I mentioned earlier on suffering with the lists. This article dives extensively into using the CSS `::marker` psuedo-element to style lists.
- [CSS Lists, Markers and Counters - smashing magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/css-lists-markers-counters/) - This article was a bonus to me it dives further into using the CSS `::marker` psuedo-element and also dives into using the CSS `counter` to style nested lists.
